Focus on your improvement and celebrate small achievements.'],\n    'High Expectations from Parents': ['Understand Their Intention: Most parents expect more because they want you to be successful, don\\'t want you to struggle like they did, and believe pressure motivates. Try to see their expectations as care, even if the method feels tough.', 'Know Your Own Strengths: You cannot be good at everything. Ask yourself: What subjects do I truly enjoy? What am I naturally good at? What kind of career suits my personality? When you know your strengths, you can explain your goals confidently.', 'Communicate Calmly (Not Emotionally): Instead of saying \"You never understand me!\" try \"I am trying my best, but I feel stressed. Can we discuss this calmly?\" Respectful communication works better than arguments.', 'Set Realistic Goals: If parents expect 95% but you\\'re scoring 75%, improve step by step and show progress. Improvement matters more than perfection.', 'Don\\'t Compare Yourself to Others: Comparison creates stress, jealousy, and low confidence.

You are not your rank. You are not someone else\\'s dream. You are your own person.', 'Involve Parents in Your Plan: Instead of rejecting their expectations, include them in your goals. Show them your study schedule, explain your career plan, and share your progress regularly. When parents see planning and effort, they feel more secure.', 'Learn to Say \"No\" Respectfully: Sometimes expectations may not match your interests.

Failure is part of learning, not the end of success.', 'Change Your Mindset: Instead of thinking \"If I fail, everything is over\" think \"If I fail, I will learn and improve.\"', 'Focus on Effort, Not Only Results: You can control your effort, not always the outcome.

Their words reflect them — not your value.', 'Stay Calm and Don\\'t React Immediately: Bullies often want a reaction. If you stay calm, they lose interest.', 'Speak Up Confidently: You can say firmly \"I don\\'t like that\" or \"Please stop.\" Simple and confident words show strength.', 'Avoid Being Alone in Risky Situations: Stay with supportive friends in places where bullying usually happens.', 'Tell a Trusted Adult: If bullying continues, inform a teacher, school counselor, or parents. Asking for help is courage, not weakness.', 'Don\\'t Respond With More Negativity: Fighting back with insults makes the situation worse. Stay respectful and mature.', 'Block and Report Online Bullies: For cyberbullying, block the person, report the account, and avoid engaging in arguments.

Interest is a strong clue for career direction.', 'Know Your Strengths: Identify if you\\'re good at problem-solving, creativity, communication, or leadership. Your strengths help narrow down options.', 'Research Different Careers: Use the internet, career websites, or talk to teachers to understand what the job involves, required qualifications, and future scope.', 'Talk to Professionals: Speak with seniors, teachers, or working professionals. Real experiences give practical clarity.', 'Take Career Guidance or Aptitude Tests: Aptitude tests help identify your skills, personality type, and suitable career fields. They don\\'t decide your future but give direction.', 'Try Internships or Small Projects: Experience helps more than theory. Even small internships or online projects can help you understand what you like.', 'Avoid Peer Pressure: Don\\'t choose a career just because your friend is choosing it, society says it\\'s \"high status,\" or it seems popular. Choose what suits YOU.', 'Think Long-Term: Ask if you can see yourself doing this for many years and whether this career will match your lifestyle goals.', 'Trust the Process: Many successful people were confused at your age.

Out of sight = out of mind.', 'Use Apps to Track Screen Time: Check how many hours you spend daily. Awareness itself reduces overuse.', 'Avoid Using Mobile Before Sleep: Using your phone late at night affects sleep and concentration the next day.', 'Replace Gaming With Productive Activities: Try sports, reading, drawing, or learning a new skill. Real-world activities give long-term benefits.', 'Turn Off Unnecessary Notifications: Constant notifications increase the urge to check your phone again and again.', 'Don’t Use Mobile as Stress Escape: Instead of escaping problems through gaming, solve them step by step.', 'Create a “No Phone” Zone: For example: Dining table, study desk, family time.

Avoid carrying guilt for things beyond your control.', 'Focus on Your Education: Education can be your long-term solution. Stay committed to your studies even during difficult times.', 'Talk to Someone You Trust: Share your feelings with a parent, teacher, close friend, or counselor. Talking reduces emotional burden.', 'Learn Basic Money Management: Understand saving habits, avoiding unnecessary expenses, and planning simple budgets. This builds responsibility and confidence.', 'Look for Scholarships or Support: If financial stress affects studies, explore school/college scholarships, government schemes, and fee concessions. Many students don’t apply simply because they don’t ask.', 'Avoid Comparing Your Situation: Every family has different struggles. Comparison increases stress and lowers confidence.', 'Help at Home in Small Ways: Support your family emotionally and practically by helping with household work, being responsible, and avoiding unnecessary demands. Small support matters.', 'Take Care of Your Mental Health: Exercise, proper sleep, and positive thinking are important during stressful times.', 'Believe That Tough Times Don’t Last Forever: Many successful people grew up with financial or family struggles.

Understanding the pattern helps you manage it.', 'Focus on What You Can Control: Ask yourself “Can I control this?” If yes → take action. If no → let it go.', 'Set a Time Limit for Thinking: Give yourself 10–15 minutes to think about a problem. After that, shift your focus to action.', 'Write Your Thoughts Down: Writing helps clear your mind. When thoughts are on paper, they feel less heavy.', 'Stay Busy With Productive Activities: Exercise, studying, hobbies, or helping at home keep your brain active in a positive way.', 'Practice Deep Breathing: Slow breathing calms the nervous system and reduces mental noise.', 'Avoid Worst-Case Thinking: Don’t automatically assume the worst. Ask: “Is there real evidence for this fear?”', 'Reduce Social Media Use: Too much scrolling increases comparison and unnecessary thoughts.', 'Talk to Someone You Trust: Sharing your thoughts with a friend, parent, or teacher often makes problems feel smaller.', 'Accept Imperfection: Not everything will be perfect — and that’s okay.
